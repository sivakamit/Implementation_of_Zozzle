# Implementation of Zozzle

ZOZZLE is a Fast and Precise In-Browser JavaScript Malware Detector. Low-overhead solution for detecting and preventing JavaScript malware. Low False positive rate. Mostly Static detectorand its suitable for in-browser deployment.

The process involues: 

Train a classifier to recognize malware 

Start with malicious and benign labeled samples

Classify the data

### Implementation

The model is created to classify the data. The model predicts the malicious and benign data

Model one uses 80% of the data for training and 20% of the data to test

Model Two uses 70% of the data for training and 30% of the data to test

The accuracy of the models are more than 90%
